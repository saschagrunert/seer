## About
A lots of development teams and whole companies facing the problem of planning
their time in an efficient manner. This can have various reasons, like too many
ongoing work or unclear requirements from customers. This ends up mostly in not
having any clear vision at all which affects the daily development and will lead
into bad software quality.

If there is no clear vision it is hard to develop a good roadmap. If there is no
good roadmap it is hard to do the weekly planning.

**This is where the seer comes in.**

Like the historic seer person it is not possible to use this tool as a solution
for something like broken communication or bad planning. It can be used to find
a clear path for the team and the company to have a better understanding of the
future (and the past). This makes the overall planning much more transparent.

What we not need is just another project management tool. We need the ability to
organize our time towards a vision.

But at the end it is up to you what you make out of the seers auguries. 👁️
